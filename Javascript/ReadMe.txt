Hi there, please find included a package with an html page and 
some resource files.

The task is described inside of the born.js file, and is focused 
on assessing you javascript knowledge.

To test if everything is working you can access the index page 
directly on any browser (the loading overlay can be tested by 
clicking on the newsletter submit button).

To complete the tasks all the comments have to be addressed and both 
the drop down ( side menu for mobile ) and loading overlay should 
be working.

Good luck!
